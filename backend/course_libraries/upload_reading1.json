Origin of Constructivism  \n Although it has become popular only recently, the origins of constructivism are believed to date back to the time of Socrates, \nwho claimed that teachers and learners should talk with each other and interpret and construct the hidden knowledge by asking \nquestions (Hilav, 1990, cited in Erdem, 2001). Gruber and Voneche (1977) also state that the term constructivism most probably \nis derived from Piaget\u2019s \u201cconstructivist\u201d views (1967), as well as from Bruner\u2019s (1996) \u201cconstructivist\u201d description of discovery \nlearning. \n Furthermore, Perkins (1992) points out that constructivism has multiple roots in psychology and philosophy of this century: \nthe developmental perspective of Jean Piaget (1969) and the emergence of cognit ive psychology under the guidance of figures \nlike Jerome Bruner (1966). \n \n1.2.

The \u201cconstructivist stance maintains that learning is a process of constructing meaning; it is how people make \nsense of their experience\u201d (Merriam and Caffarella, 1999, p. 260). \n Mvududu and Thiel-Burgess (2012) state that constructivism is widely touted as an appr oach to probe for children\u2019s level \nof understanding and to show that that understanding can increase and change to higher level thinking.

Piaget's theory includes two major parts, a\"ages and stages\" component that predicts what children can and cannot \nunderstand at different ages, and a\u201d theory of development\u201d that describes how children develop cognitive abilities. Piaget (1977) \nasserts that learning does not occur passively; rather it occurs by active construction of meaning. He explains that when we,  as \nlearners, encounter an experience or a situation that challenges the way we think, a state of disequilibrium or imbalance is created.",

On the contrary, Vygotsky \nstated that the child\u2019s mind is inherently social in nature and so speech moves from communicative social to inner egocentric . \nTherefore, since the development of thought follows the development of speech, Vygotsky claims that thought develops from \nsociety to the individual and not the other way. \n \n1.2.
